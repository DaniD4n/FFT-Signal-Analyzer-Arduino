# Arduino Firmware

This directory contains the Arduino firmware responsible for
analog signal acquisition and serial transmission.

## Description
- Reads analog data from pin A0
- Converts 10-bit ADC values to 8-bit resolution
- Sends data continuously via USB serial

## Notes
- Designed for Arduino Uno
- Maximum effective sampling rate ≈ 4 kHz
- No DC offset implemented (unipolar input only)
