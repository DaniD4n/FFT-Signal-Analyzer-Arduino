# 📡 Arduino-Based Signal Spectrometer

This project was developed during the course **Introduction to Electrical Engineering (2025.1)** at the
Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG).

The system is capable of **acquiring, amplifying, filtering, and analyzing analog signals**, providing
real-time visualization in both the **time domain** and the **frequency domain** using the
**Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**.
